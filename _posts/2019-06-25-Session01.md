### Lab 1: June 26, 2019
Today in lab we were introduced to the protoboards(also known as breadboards) that we would be working with over the course of the next couple of weeks. This was my first time working with circuits in a physical sense. I was also introduced to the Arduino hardware and later during the lab experimented with the software aspect.

This is what the empty breadboard and arduino microcontroller looked like:

After getting just one LED to turn on I decided to do a little experimenting. This is the setup to make two LEDs light up.

After that I decided to start experimenting with the Arduino IDE software. I worked with the original blink program to create a longer blink of about five seconds.

We were also introduced to using motors during this lab. At first the setup pretty much micmicked the LED setup but in place of the LED was a motor. After the first few motor setups I soldered my wires to my motor to create a more efficient circuit.

After getting the motor to run smoothly I decided to have a little fun and put a button in my motor circuit.
