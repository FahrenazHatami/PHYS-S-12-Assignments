<h1 class="glow">Lab July 31, 2019</h1>
This week we learned about molding and casting. We watched a quick demo on how to create a mold of an object using a two part silicone material, and then cast it using powdered plaster mixed with a little bit of water. We also were given a tutorial on how to create actuators using a sewing machine. 


<h2>The Mold</h2>
 <p> Making my mold was a pretty simple process.It took a little less than twenty minutes to make but did create a few problems here and there. The first thing I had to do was settle on what I wanted to make a mold for. At first I was going to use the cap of an old perfume bottle that had a nice flower design on it, but unfortunately it was a little big. Instead I decided to use on of my rings that had a shape design on it. The next step was to figure out how I was going to place my ring to make the mold. I couldn't just lay it flat at the bottom of a cup because the whole ring wouldn't translate correctly, so I decided to use of of Rob's tricks. I took some string and tied one side around my ring and the other around a popsicle stick. I then placed the popsicle stick on the top of the cup so that my ring would be suspended about halfway up my tiny cup. Next I mixed the two parts of silicone and started to fill, but this proved more tedious than it probably should have been. In an attempt to conserve the molding materials I continously made too little silicone, and had to remake the molding material at least three times. I also managed to get quite a bit of airbubbles into the mold, but most seemed to pop at some point in the pouring process. Afterwards all that was left was to wait. </p>

   <h2>The Product</h2>
   <p> As easy as I thought the mold making process was it turns out getting a nice clean product wasn't as simple as I thought it would be. When my mold had finished setting I came across a very big issue. How was I supposed to cut out my ring without damaging the mold? The answer? I couldn't. I ended up cutting the mold into two parts and tried to use it as if it was a two piece mold, but my end product left much to be desired... </p>
