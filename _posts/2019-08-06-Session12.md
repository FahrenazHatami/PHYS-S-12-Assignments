### Final Project Concept

The final project concept I wanted to explore is an automated fish tank. It would make taking care of fish more simple and less hands on. The tank would have the following features:

1. A water filter
2. Custom 3-D printed decorations
3. The tank itself(made of acrylic)

### Progress July 3rd, 2019

Today I started work on my automatic feeder prototype. I set up a servo motor that will later spin a small bottle of food 180 degrees every twelve hours. I also found Arduino code that would do this, but in order to do a few test I changed the numbers so the servo would turn more often.

### Progress July 24, 2019

Today some items I ordered off amazon came in the mail. These items included Zeolite(which I am using as my filter media), fish food, and water conditioner. The first thing I did was to fill my filter cannister with some of the zeolite and making sure that none of it entered the main central tube. Next I wanted to test that the fish food I had would fall out of my feeder when the cap as turned 180 degrees, but it seems that the holes are a bit to small. My next steps will be to update my feeder to consist of a larger holding container with bigger holes so that the food can fall through correctly.
