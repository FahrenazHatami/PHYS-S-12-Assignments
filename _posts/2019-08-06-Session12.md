### Final Project Concept

For my final project I would like to create a smart planter box that would serve to make growing plants easier and less time consuming. The proposed box would potentially have the following features:

1. Soil Moisture Sensor
2. Temperature and Humidity Sensor
3. Light Exposure Sensor
4. Automated Watering System
