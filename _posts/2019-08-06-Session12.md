### Final Project Concept

The final project concept I wanted to explore is an automated fish tank. It would make taking care of fish more simple and less hands on. The tank would have the following features:

1. A water filter
2. Custom 3-D printed decorations
3. The tank itself(made of acrylic)

Today I started work on my automatic feeder prototype. I set up a servo motor that will later spin a small bottle of food 180 degrees every twelve hours. I also found Arduino code that would do this, but in order to do a few test I changed the numbers so the servo would turn more often.

Today some items I ordered off amazon came in the mail. These items included Zeolite(which I am using as my filter media), fish food, and water conditioner. The first thing I did was to fill my filter cannister with some of the zeolite and making sure that none of it entered the main central tube. Next I wanted to test that the fish food I had would fall out of my feeder when the cap as turned 180 degrees, but it seems that the holes are a bit to small. My next steps will be to update my feeder to consist of a larger holding container with bigger holes so that the food can fall through correctly.

### Progress July 26, 2019

Not too long ago I ran a test on the small automated fish feeder to see if the fish food I ordered would fall through the holes when the container was turned 180 degrees. Unfortunately the holes proved to be way too small and sparsly distributed for the food pellets to fall through. Today I took a small travel sized shampoo bottle and made it suitable to replace my old feeder container. I marked the bottle with a black sharpie to know where to make the holes. Then I took the smallest bit I could find in the lab and used the electric hand drill to make a couple of holes on one surface of the bottle. I did a few rounds of trying to filter the food pellets through and finally made the right sized holes. Once I was happy with the holes I decided to create a mount for the bottle to fit onto the servo head. Since the bottom of the bottle wasn't flat I used an old laser cut cog that I made earlier this summer as a base. I hot glued the bottle to the cog and then glued the servo head to the other side of the cog. This worked pretty well considering how small the servo is and how heavy/big the bottle is in comparison.
