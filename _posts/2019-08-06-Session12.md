### Final Project Concept

The final project concept I wanted to explore is an automated fish tank. It would make taking care of fish more simple and less hands on. The tank would have the following features:

1. A water filter
2. Custom 3-D printed decorations
3. The tank itself(made of acrylic)

### Progress July 3rd, 2019

Today I started work on my automatic feeder prototype. I set up a servo motor that will later spin a small bottle of food 180 degrees every twelve hours. I also found Arduino code that would do this, but in order to do a few test I changed the numbers so the servo would turn more often.
