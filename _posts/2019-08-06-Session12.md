### Final Project Concept

For my final project I would like to create a smart planter box that would serve to make growing plants easier and less time consuming. The proposed box would potentially have the following features:

1. Soil Moisture Sensor
2. Temperature and Humidity Sensor
3. Light Exposure Sensor
4. Automated Watering System

### Idea 2: Fish Tank

Another final project concept I wanted to explore is an automated fish tank. It would make taking care of fish more simple and less hands on. The tank would have the following features:

1. A water filter
2. Custom 3-D printed decorations
3. The tank itself(made of acrylic)
