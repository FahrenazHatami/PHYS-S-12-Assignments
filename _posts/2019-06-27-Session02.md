### Lab 2 June 27, 2019 and Lab 3 June 28, 2019

In today's lab we pulled out our circuits from the previous lab and explored measuring voltage. We also took a look at the different kinds of microcontrollers and what they are made up of. Also discussed during today's lab is Ohm's law, which is the equation that allows one to calculate voltage, current, or resistance.

This is what the voltmeter we used looked like

By pulling the wire just a little bit out of my breadboard and exposing it, I was able to gently press the voltmeter against the exposed wire and saw the fluctuating voltage. My volatge went from zero to about 4.6 because my motor was still running my blink program from the fisrt lab as seen in the video bellow.

After that we ran a program that used analog input pin 0 and then printed the results in the Serial Monitor. 

This is what the program looked like:

And these were the results from the program shown in the Serial Monitor:
