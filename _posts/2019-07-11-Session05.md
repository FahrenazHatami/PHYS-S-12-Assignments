### Lab July 12th, 2019:

During Thurday's class we were introduced to programming Arduinos. We learned how to use buttons as input which would then light an LED acting as an output. After learning a bit about the coding language Arduino uses, and being introduced to things like for loops and conditional statements, we were given an assignment for today's lab. Our assignment was to create a circuit that used a button as an input and also included a for loop in our program. For lab today I created a circuit that was almost a culmination of the examples we saw yesterday. For the first five seconds of my program my blue LED would be lit as bright as possible wheter or not the button was pressed. After the first five seconds however, if the button was not pressed the LED would remain off. If the button was on, the LED would light up with varying brightness levels ranged from zero to 255(the highest brightness level) in increments of 50. 


This is how I setup my breadboard:

This is what my Arduino program looked like:

Here is what my final circuit looked like while running:
